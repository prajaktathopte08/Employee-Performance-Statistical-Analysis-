# Employee-Performance-Statistical-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **statistical analysis using the NumPy library** on an employee performance dataset. The goal is to understand salary distribution, variation, relationships between variables, and overall data behavior using core statistical concepts.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand real-world numerical data using statistics
* Apply NumPy functions for statistical analysis
* Analyze salary patterns and employee performance
* Identify variation, distribution, and relationships in data

## 📁 Dataset Information

* **File Name:** employee_performance_data.csv
* **Records:** 800 employees
* **Columns:** 20 numerical features

### 🔑 Key Columns

* Age
* Experience_Years
* Monthly_Salary
* Performance_Score
* Training_Hours
* Stress_Level
* Job_Satisfaction
* Attrition_Risk_Score

The dataset contains only numerical values, making it suitable for NumPy-based analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded CSV data using NumPy
* Verified shape and structure of the dataset

### 2. Descriptive Statistics

* Mean (Average salary)
* Median (Middle salary)
* Mode (Most frequent salary)

### 3. Dispersion Measures

* Variance
* Standard Deviation
* Range
* Interquartile Range (IQR)

### 4. Distribution Analysis

* Percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th)
* Skewness
* Kurtosis

### 5. Relationship Analysis

* Correlation between Experience and Salary
* Correlation between Stress Level and Job Satisfaction

### 6. Normalization & Outliers

* Z-score normalization
* Outlier detection using Z-scores

### 7. Logical Analysis

* Employees earning above average salary
* High-performing employee analysis
* Attrition risk identification

## 📈 Key Insights

* Salaries show significant variation across employees
* Experience alone does not strongly influence salary
* Salary distribution is nearly symmetrical
* Training has a positive impact on performance
* A small number of employees earn significantly higher salaries

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NumPy can be effectively used to perform statistical analysis on real-world data and derive meaningful insights related to employee salary and performance.
